    <h1>Oggy & Cockroches</h1>
    <header>
        Oggy, an anthropomorphic cat, spends his days watching television and eating but is continually pestered by three cockroaches (Joey, Marky, and Dee Dee). The roaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator (mostly) to hijacking the train he just boarded. In many situations, Oggy is also helped by his cousin, Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the cockroaches. Other recurring characters include Bob, a short-tempered bulldog and Oggy's neighbor, and Olivia, a female cat who becomes Oggy's love interest.
